# Summer Undergraduate Data Science (SUDS) Research Program: Introduction To R


# Introduction
"The SUDS Opportunities Program is an ideal way to get involved in a high-quality and enriching data science opportunity and to experience applications of data science methods and tools in a range of application areas. " For more informtion, see: https://datasciences.utoronto.ca/suds-cohort-program-2022/

### Date: 3 June 2022, Friday 
### Time: 10 am to 4 pm EST
### Institute: University of Toronto (St.George)


# Materials
* **Learners must have internet connection, and a computer with administrative privileges, a microphone, and all required software installed in order to participate in online activities.** 
* **Learners must have R (http://www.r-project.org/). We will help with downloading.**
* **Learners must have RStudio (Previously: http://www.rstudio.com/; now: https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/). We will help with downloading.**
* Screen space can be a limitation during online learning since you'll want to see the instructor's screen and have your RStudio open so that you can type along. If you have access to a second monitor or a larger tablet to attend the course while keeping your laptop screen available for coding - this would be great! If not - don't worry, we'll manage!

-   Slides covered in the lectures were originally developed by Anjali Silva.

- We wish to acknowledge this land on which the University of Toronto operates. For thousands of years it has been the traditional land of the Huron-Wendat, the Seneca, and most recently, the Mississaugas of the Credit River. Today, this meeting place is still the home to many Indigenous people from across Turtle Island and we are grateful to have the opportunity to work on this land.
